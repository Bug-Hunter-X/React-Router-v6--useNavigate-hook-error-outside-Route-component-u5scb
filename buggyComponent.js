In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that hasn't fully mounted.  This often manifests as an error stating that `useNavigate` is being called outside of a `Route` component or during the server-side rendering.  The problem is that `useNavigate` relies on the React Router context, which might not be available yet.

```javascript
// buggyComponent.js
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function BuggyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    // This will cause an error if the component hasn't fully mounted
    navigate('/another-route'); 
  }, []);

  return <div>Buggy Component</div>;
}

export default BuggyComponent;
```
