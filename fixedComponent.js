The solution involves ensuring that `useNavigate` is called only after the component has successfully mounted. This is achieved by using the `useEffect` hook and a dependency array to control when `navigate` is executed.

```javascript
// fixedComponent.js
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function FixedComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    // navigate is called only after the component is mounted
    navigate('/another-route'); 
  }, [navigate]); // navigate is added as a dependency

  return <div>Fixed Component</div>;
}

export default FixedComponent;
```

By adding `navigate` to the dependency array, the effect runs only once after the component mounts and after `useNavigate` has access to the React Router context.  This prevents the error and ensures correct navigation.
